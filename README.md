# Node Controlling WebApp

To use, first copy over .envtemplate to .env, set uncomment out the MONGO_SEED var so it will create the first users
Npm install all items, it will require that ou have bower, node-gyp, and grunt-cli installed globally, no SASS required
after that just run node server.js or grunt, the grunt may fail due to non-standard conforming formatting, if you would fix this it would work
